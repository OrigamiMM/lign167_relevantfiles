Note: for the local test, it requires the stable diffusion v1-5 github repo download with weights. Large download can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers

The Final model can be found on colab link listed on the final paper. If link does not work, can run the same notebook found at this repo on "StableDiffusionTerrainGeneration_FINAL.ipynb"
